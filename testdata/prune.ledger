; "pruning" allows ledger-lot to construct multiple FIFO queues for the same currency.

; in this example, we acquire some ABC, and put it into a hardware
; wallet for safe long-term storage.  Later, we make trades on an
; exchange, temporarily holding ABC as a bridge to trade two other
; currencies.  If ledger-lot maintains a single FIFO queue for ABC, we
; realize gains as if we sold our long-held ABC.  If maintaining
; multiple FIFO for ABC, we do not consume our long-held inventory and
; do not realize those gains.

; this example uses the following account names to distinguish
; multiple on-chain wallets, a hardware wallet, and a balance at the
; CoinFace exchange:

;    Assets:Crypto:on-chain:hot
;    Assets:Crypto:on-chain:cold
;    Assets:Crypto:hardware
;    Assets:Crypto:CoinFace

; If -prune=3, ledger-lot creates distinct FIFOs for on-chain,
; hardware and CoinFace (on-chain:hot and on-chain:cold use the same
; FIFO).  If -prune=4 or higher, ledger-lot creates a FIFO for each
; account (hot and cold are now distinct FIFOs). And if -prune=0, all
; ABC uses a single FIFO (this is the default).

; Decimal precision for various currencies.

2016-01-01 Received ABC
    Assets:Crypto:on-chain:hot                   100 ABC @ 0.01 USD
    Income:Air Drop                            

; Move some assets to a cold wallet for safe keeping.
; note how ledger-lot treats this transaction when -prune=4
2016-01-02 Transfer ABC
    Assets:Crypto:on-chain:hot                   -90 ABC             
    Assets:Crypto:on-chain:cold              

; TODO(dnc): this is not currently working...
2016-01-02 Transfer ABC
    Assets:Crypto:on-chain:hot                            
    Assets:Crypto:on-chain:cold                   90 ABC

; Much later, we decide to buy some XYZ.  The CoinFace exchange uses
; ABC as a base, so in order to acquire XYZ, we temporarily hold some
; ABC.  Note how ledger-lot calculates gains depending on -prune=3 vs
; -prune=0.

2018-02-01 Deposit funds for trading
    Assets:Crypto:CoinFace                       100 USD
    Equity

2018-02-02 Trade USD/ABC when 1 ABC costs $100
    Assets:Crypto:CoinFace                       100 ABC @ 100.00 USD
    Assets:Crypto:CoinFace

; This transaction consumes ABC inventory.  If we consume the ABC
; purchased in 2016, we realize a gain.  If we consume the ABC
; purchased in 2018, we will not. The -prune argument controls
; ledger-lot's behavior.
2018-02-03 Trade XYZ/ABC when 1 XYZ costs 1 ABC
    Assets:Crypto:CoinFace                       100 XYZ @ 1.00 USD
    Assets:Crypto:CoinFace                        -1 ABC @ 100 USD
